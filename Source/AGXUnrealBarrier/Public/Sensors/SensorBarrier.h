	 * Increment the reference count of the AGX Dynamics object. This should always be paired with
	 * a call to DecrementRefCount, and the count should only be artificially incremented for a
	 * very well specified duration.
	 *
	 * One use-case is during a Blueprint Reconstruction, when the Unreal Engine objects are
	 * destroyed and then recreated. During this time the AGX Dynamics objects are retained and
	 * handed between the old and the new Unreal Engine objects through a Component Instance Data.
	 * This Component Instance Data instance is considered the owner of the AGX Dynamics object
	 * during this transition period and the reference count is therefore increment during its
	 * lifetime. We're lending out ownership of the AGX Dynamics object to the Component Instance
	 * Data instance for the duration of the Blueprint Reconstruction.
	 *
	 * These functions can be const even though they have observable side effects because the
	 * reference count is not a salient part of the AGX Dynamics objects, and they are thread-safe.
